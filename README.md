  <h2 align="center">PhantomCap</h2>
  <p align="center"><strong>Explore Sui blockchain UpgradeCaps and Packages</strong></p>
  <p align="center">Monitor package upgrades, version history, and transfer events in real-time</p>
</p>

## Usage

1. Go to [SuiVision](https://suivision.xyz/)
2. Find some project
3. Insert `.phacap` between `suivision` and `.xyz` and analyze package capabilities comfortably

## Motivation
Finding packages UpgradeCap and real owner directly on SuiScan or SuiVision sucks! You need to spend a lot of time scrolling through transactions to find it. Also their "immutable" badges try to inspire confidence, but it's not true in most cases.

PhantomCap was born out of frustration, and it's here to fix all of transparency issues.

## Goal

PhantomCap is a fully open-source, public good that is available for anyone and is developed by a community. Other blockchain explorers can use it/self-host it instead of developing the same thing again.
